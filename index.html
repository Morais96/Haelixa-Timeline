                    <p class="timeline__content-desc">Cotton is fully mature and ready for harvesting approximately 160 days  after being planted. Once the bolls have burst open, the farmers can prepare the cotton plants for harvesting. One of the biggest threats to a cotton crop is weather—rain, specifically—so it must be harvested on time to avoid damage, which would negatively impact yield.</p>
